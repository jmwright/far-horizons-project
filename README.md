# Far Horizons Project

***NOTE:*** This is an archive of the [Far Horizons](https://www.adlerplanetarium.org/learn/all-ages/far-horizons/) documentation that was orginally posted on [OpenDesignEngine](https://opendesignengine.net/projects/far-horizons-project) by [Adler Planetarium](https://www.adlerplanetarium.org/) and [Mach 30](http://mach30.org/). It is retained here for future reference.

Far Horizons is a program of Adler Planetarium in Chicago, IL, USA. One project of Far Horizons is a High Altitude Balloon (HAB) platform which affords researchers of all ages access to "near space" with a maximum altitude of approximately 100,000 feet (30480 meters). The Far Horizons HAB platform is being documented here in the hopes that it will facilitate the experiments of other people with an interest in HAB use and research.

There are two locations containing the documentation from the original project.

1. The documentation originally available under DMSF in Open Design Engine is available in the [Documents](https://github.com/jmwright/far-horizons-project/tree/main/Documents) directory.
2. The wiki is contained within the [Wiki](https://github.com/jmwright/far-horizons-project/tree/main/Wiki) directory, and has been modified for GitHub markdown compatibility and image locations.
