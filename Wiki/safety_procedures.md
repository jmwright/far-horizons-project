# Safety Procedures

* ***FHPSP 1.1*** Anyone who is holding down the balloon during fill and/or launch should wear leather gloves to protect against abrasion and pinch injuries.
* ***FHPSP 1.2*** Ensure that anyone with latex allergies is not exposed to the balloon during flight operations involving latex based balloons.
* ***FHPSP 1.3*** When switching helium tanks, make sure to close the main valve on the tank first before closing the secondary regulator. Otherwise pressure could get trapped in the secondary regulatorâ€™s body that is then released forcefully when the connector is loosened with the crescent wrench.
