## Discussion/Work

* Create Block Diagram
    * Determined there are 3 major sub-systems
        * Flight Vehicle - all the parts that fly to altitude
        * Setup System - the tools/equipment needed to prepare and launch the flight vehicle
        * Chase and Recovery System - the vehicle and supporting equipment needed to locate and recover the flight vehicle
    * Developed sub-block diagrams on the flip chart for each sub-system (see below)
