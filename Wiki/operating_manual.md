# Operating Manual

The items below have been gleaned from meeting notes and video obtained during the Far Horizons design meetings and launch.

TODO: These need to be put in the correct order and formed into a proper set of procedures. A format for the procedures needs to be decided on for this page.

## Equipment Checklist

[ODT](https://github.com/jmwright/far-horizons-project/blob/main/Documents/Operations_Documents/Equipment_Checklist.odt) (Open Document Text) and [PDF](https://github.com/jmwright/far-horizons-project/blob/main/Documents/Operations_Documents/Equipment_Checklist.pdf) versions of this checklist are available [here](https://github.com/jmwright/far-horizons-project/tree/main/Documents/Operations_Documents).

* Equipment duffle bag
* Crescent wrench(es) >= 1-1/8" opening
* Kitchen scale
* Hanging scale
* Regulator and custom fill connector
* Cotton (jersey/gardening) gloves
* Leather gloves
* Zip tie cutter
* Binoculars
* Helium tanks
* Ground tarp
* Duct tape
* Parachute
* Balloons (two for redundancy)
* Extendable painters pole (30’) with roller mount for hook if desired
* A copy of the Far Horizons Flight Log Sheet (ODS or PDF ) Instructions for the use of the log sheet can be found here.
* Flight path prediction printout

There are additional screen captures of the setup and launch process [here](https://github.com/jmwright/far-horizons-project/tree/main/Documents/Images/Still_Frames). The screen captures below show the name of the video they came from, and the time to seek to within the video. This will allow you to see more detail of how a step in the process is done. Refer to the [Launch Videos](launch_videos.md) page for a full list of the launch day videos.

Keep in mind that you may want to do some sections of the procedures in parallel. For instance, you may want to assemble the tubular payload platform and attach the payloads while other members of your team prepare the balloon itself.

## 1.0 Pre-Departure Operations

These are operations that are completed before the launch and chase teams leave for the launch site.

* ***FHPOM 1.1*** Break personnel up into teams based on experience and interests, but make sure to have a minimum amount of people on each setup task.
* ***FHPOM 1.2*** Make sure that your balloons are not up against anything that might damage them in your equipment transport bag.
* ***FHPOM 1.3*** Once you have ensured that all of the equipment is in the transport bag, secure it with zip ties or some other method to keep someone from removing items.

## 2.0 Setup Operations

These operations cover assembling the flight vehicle and attaching the payload(s).

* ***FHPOM 2.1*** Weigh each component of the flight vehicle to ensure that it’s not over 12 lbs total, and that no single component weighs more than 6 lbs. Enter this information in the "PAYLOAD WEIGHTS" section of the [Flight Log Sheet](https://github.com/jmwright/far-horizons-project/tree/main/Documents/Operations_Documents).

* ***FHPOM 2.2*** Calculate the amount of lift needed based on payload weight(s) and ascent rate.
* ***FHPOM 2.3*** Set up a workspace by laying out the ground tarp and ensuring that it is clean and free of debris, oils, etc. “Clean is key”.

* ***FHPOM 2.4*** Lay the helium tanks on one side of the tarp to help keep it from blowing away.

* ***FHPOM 2.5*** Remove the safety cover from the helium tank(s).
* ***FHPOM 2.6*** Attach the custom built fill connector’s regulator to the first helium tank.
